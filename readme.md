# Code2000

This is a classic font whose website went down ages ago:

* http://www.code2000.net (website long gone)
* https://web.archive.org/web/20101122141939/http://code2000.net/ internet archive mirror
* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code2000

I don't own the rights to this code. I'm just trying to maintain the Arch Linux package, whose upstream links had all broken: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ttf-code2000/

If you own the rights, by all means please host this properly and let me know, and I'll take this down.
